Business Problem & Target Audience:
This prediction model will use sample data of car collisions/accidents from a city and use the same to predict accident severity based on factors from the sample data such as light condition, weather condition and road condition.This prediction model will help goverment authority responsible to road transport safety to derive insight and send alerts through SMS and safety boards on road where based on these fearures chances of severe accidents is high.

Description of Data:
Sample data is of accident information. It provides accident severity along with several features including light condition, weather condition and road condition etc associated with the accident record. We will use these features and check if prediction model for accident severity can be built based on these features to help  government autority to take measure to avoid the severe accidents.

Prediction Model:
K Means and Logistic regression models have been used to derive prediction model for accident severity. Both the models' accuracy and precision have been checked and found that using logistic regression a good prediction model for accident severity based on features- light condition, weather condition and road condition can be built.

Results :
Using logictic regression model accident severity has been derived with 72% accuracy.
